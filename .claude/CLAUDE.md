- Never add all files to git. Always only add modified and added files one by one.
- Do not ever use unicode characters.
- ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before running any Python commands:
  - On Windows (Git Bash): source venv/Scripts/activate
  - On Linux/Raspberry Pi: source venv/bin/activate
- IMPORTANT: Before committing to git, ALWAYS run: python scripts/run_all_checks.py
  - This checks code formatting (black), linting (ruff), type checking (mypy), runs all tests, checks code quality metrics, and measures code coverage.
  - If any checks fail, fix the issues before committing.
  - Use --fix flag to auto-fix formatting and linting: python scripts/run_all_checks.py --fix
  - Use --quick flag to skip coverage for faster checks: python scripts/run_all_checks.py --quick
- When committing, NEVER use git add -A or git add . - always add files individually
- Do not use default values in Dict().get(key, ...) unless explicitly requested by human operator. Check the output if the key was found and show error message and abort program run if that happens.
